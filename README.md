### Hi there 👋

#### Background 📚📖
As you already know, my name is Matt. Tech has always had a grip on me. Growing up, I took my first steps into the tech world through gaming, building PC's, and programming Arduino+Rasperry Pi's to complete simple tasks. That passion has lead me to where I am today as a Data Scienctist within the Insurance industry. 

Thanks for stopping by!
