### Hi there 👋

#### Background 📚📖
As you already know, my name is Matt. Tech has always had a grip on me. Growing up, I took my first steps into the tech world through gaming, building PC's, and programming Arduino+Rasperry Pi's to complete simple tasks. That passion has lead me to where I am today as a Data Scienctist within the Insurance industry. 

#### About Me 🧑🏻‍💻
I have a passion for learning. Outside of work, I spend much of my time competing in Kaggle Hackathons for fun, writing blogs at my personal Data Science blog [DataScienceVerse](www.datascienceverse.net), or creating content at [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCabrFMWPo6h7Q9WHC8VZzFw).

Thanks for stopping by!
